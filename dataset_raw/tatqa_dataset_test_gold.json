We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. In addition, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the provisions of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective method. We recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to receivables of $7.6 million, an increase to inventories of $2.8 million, an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.9 million, an increase to other accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of $0.2 million. The adjustments primarily related to the timing of recognition of certain customer charges, trade promotional expenditures, and volume discounts."

Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May 27, 2018, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $32.5 million, excluding a related liability of $7.7 million for gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was an expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2019, an expense of $1.6 million in fiscal 2018, and a benefit of $0.3 million in fiscal 2017."

The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors."

Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 60 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset\u2019s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to shortterm receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial."

The Company uses an internal management reporting system, which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the Company\u2019s resources on a regional basis. Net sales for the segments are attributed to the region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed. The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments. A segment\u2019s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income (loss). A segment\u2019s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses\u00a0 fiscal 2019 and the $13.5 million one-time employee bonus paid to full-time, non-executive employees during fiscal 2018 due to the Company's ability to access overseas cash as a result of Tax Reform (the \"one-time employee bonus\"). These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments. Inter-segment transactions are generally recorded at amounts that approximate arm\u2019s length transactions. The accounting policies for the segments are the same as for the Company taken as a whole."

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of Golden Ridge\u2019s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 28, 2018.

In July 2019, we reached an agreement to settle the $0.6 million working capital adjustment receivable and other claims with the sellers of Golden Ridge. As a result, (i) 340,000 shares of common stock held in the escrow account ($1.0 million fair value as of both the settlement date and the November 28, 2018, acquisition date) were returned to us and retired, (ii) the remaining $0.4 million note payable we owed to a seller was cancelled and (iii) certain open grain purchase contracts with entities related to a seller were terminated. We recorded a gain on the noncash settlement of $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, which is included in other income. In connection with the foregoing, a settlement agreement was entered into among the parties. All shares of common stock were distributed and the escrow agreement was terminated."

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar."

Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $19.3 million. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $3.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018."

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers projected future taxable income, carryback opportunities, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company decreased its valuation allowance by $12.8 million which relates to a reduction in the valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credits offset by an increase in valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses."

Subscription and maintenance: Revenue is deferred and is subsequently recognised over the period in which the subscription service is provided. As the billing structure for customers is often bundled with licenses and billed on activation, there is an allocation methodology applied based on stand-alone selling prices to calculate the portion of revenue to be deferred. 3. Search advertising: Revenue is recognised at a point in time on a price-per-click basis, this is when a user engages with the search result on the website by clicking on it. 4. Services revenue: Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Services include training and implementation services. 5. Other revenue - Royalties: Royalties related to IP are recognised at a point in time when the subsequent sales occurs. 6. Interest income: Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the assets net carrying amount."

Excluding the impact of the surcharge revenue, our gross margin in fiscal year 2019 was 22.9 percent compared to 21.3 percent in fiscal year 2018. The results reflect the impact of improved product mix coupled with capacity gains and operating cost reductions compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal year 2019 also reflects an $11.4 million benefit related to an insurance recovery in our third fiscal quarter."

The remaining increase was principally the result of a $2.9 million increase in hosting and software related cost to support research and development activities and an increase of $0.3 million in software subscription cost which was offset by a $1.0 million decrease in office related expenses to support research and development activities. A total of $7.8 million of internally-developed software costs during 2018 and $6.3 million of internally-developed software costs during 2017 were capitalized, resulting in a decrease of the expense by $1.4 million compared to 2017."

The value of a wafer is determined principally by the complexity and performance of the processing technology used to produce the wafer, as well as by the yield and defect density. Production of devices with higher levels of functionality and performance, with better yields and lower defect density as well as with greater system-level integration requires better manufacturing expertise and generally commands higher wafer prices. The increase in price generally has more than offset associated increases in production cost once an appropriate economy of scale is reached."

As a result, we have continuously been migrating to increasingly sophisticated technologies to maintain the same level of profitability.

We introduced our 28-nanometer technology to customers in 2011 and started large-scale commercial production in 2014. Our 28nm and below technologies contributed approximately 17.1%, 15.2% and 11.3% of our foundry revenue in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively."

Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal. Should actual market conditions differ from the Company\u2019s estimates, the Company\u2019s future results of operations could be materially affected. Reductions in inventory valuation are included in Cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand, product lifecycle status and product development plans. The Company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reduce the inventory cost basis. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values."

This reduction in headcount also contributed to a decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs of $0.5 million in 2019. We also experienced a decrease of $0.9 million in hosting costs in 2019, due to a decline in the usage of our hosted platform as compared to 2018.

Currently, we recognize revenue from clients with executed contracts, and from clients without a contractual agreement where we recognize revenue on a cash basis given the uncertainty over reimbursement.

Lastly, we have implemented an increase in the patient financial responsibility which is collected prior to testing to ensure that at least a partial payment is received for every test performed, we expect unpaid and partial paid orders to decline, which will likely result in a decline in total GPS orders and revenue in the short-term."

The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms."

These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 27, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $218 million, of which approximately $77 million was recorded as deferred revenue."

The constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Teradyne maintained a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of $77.2 million and $69.9 million, respectively, primarily related to state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards, due to the uncertainty regarding their realization. Adjustments could be required in the future if Teradyne estimates that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount recorded."

These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, our Customer support renewal rate was approximately 91%, stable compared with the Customer support renewal rate during the quarter ended June 30, 2018."

A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carry-forwards can be utilized. We assess all positive and negative evidence when determining the amount of the net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, prior earnings history, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable."

Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. As of April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to reduce its existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense. For the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $1.3 million and $9.4 million, respectively."

Revenue during fiscal 2018 was also unfavorably affected by a shift in the mix of sales towards subscription and cloud-delivered solutions subject to ratable revenue recognition, which resulted in less in-period recognized revenue and more revenue deferred to the balance sheet as compared to fiscal 2017. Operating income increased $286 million primarily due to higher revenue discussed above, a $51 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $38 million decrease in cost of revenues."

The EC concluded that this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules. However, whilst we are awaiting further detail from HMRC, the position has not changed from a tax accounting perspective. The risk is possible, but not probable. UK ministers have yet to decide on whether to pursue an appeal.

In addition, demand for our NAND products was adversely affected by the transition from SATA SSDs to NVMe SSDs. The higher NAND sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of high-value mobile managed NAND products as well as discrete NAND products enabled by our execution in ramping 64- and 96-layer TLC 3D NAND."

The group of assets we contributed and derecognized met the definition of a business and included cash, fixed assets, customer relationships and an allocation of goodwill, with an aggregate book value of $7 million. The fair value of our equity interest in LNTL was determined using discounted cash flow techniques to be $80 million, resulting in a non-cash gain of $73 million. We accounted for our ownership interest as an equity method investment and have presented it in Other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of April 26, 2019. LNTL will be integral to our sales channels strategy in China, acting as a distributor of our offerings to customers headquartered there, and involved in certain OEM sales to Lenovo. It will also endeavor to localize our products and services, and to develop new joint offerings for the China market by leveraging NetApp and Lenovo technologies."

The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately."

The combined insurance entity generated a net operating loss for the year due to additional tax deductions related to increases in policy holder reserves. In addition, the bargain purchase gain is not taxable. This net operating loss was carried forward but had a valuation allowance. Additionally, the income tax expense generated from the sale of BeneVir in the second quarter of 2018 is offset by tax attributes for which a valuation allowance had been recorded.

For contracts that include renewal provisions, revenue is recognized up-front upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligations, but payments are received upon renewal. Renewals occur in bi-annual and annual increments over the associated expected contract term, the majority of which range from two to five years. The Company\u2019s contracts with customers under multi-year arrangements generally have three-year terms and are invoiced annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. The Company records a receivable related to revenue recognized under multi-year arrangements as the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to these arrangements."

With respect to multi-year year arrangements, there is minimal difference between the consideration received and the cash selling price, any offered discounts are driven by volume, and the contracts are of short duration resulting in insignificant interest. Thus, the primary purpose of the invoicing terms on the multi-year arrangements is to provide the customer with a simplified and predictable way of purchasing certain products, not to provide financing or to receive financing from the Company\u2019s customer."

We also grant equity-based awards that contain service conditions as well as additional market or performance conditions. For awards having both service and market conditions, the award fair value is calculated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Awards with service as well as market or performance conditions specify a target number of shares for the award, although each recipient ultimately has the opportunity to receive between 0% and 200% of the target number of shares. For awards with service and market conditions, the percentage received is based on our total shareholder return over the three-year service period versus that of selected peer companies. For awards with service and performance conditions, the percentage received depends upon the attainment of one or more financial performance targets during the two or\u00a0three-year service period."

Absent resolution of significant tax controversy, the associated impact on the reserve balance is estimated to be a decrease in the range of $4.6 to $6.6 million during 2020."
