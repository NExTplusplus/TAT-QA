The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately."

This decrease reflected lower volume of GPS samples sequenced and recognized as revenue in the current year resulting from deliveries for patients covered by contract and non-contracted payers. Currently, we recognize revenue from clients with executed contracts, and from clients without a contractual agreement where we recognize revenue on a cash basis given the uncertainty over reimbursement. As we gain additional insurance coverage, including coverage under government insurance programs, we expect to be able to reduce the portion of sequencing and molecular analysis revenue which is recognized on a cash basis."

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar."

These increases in operating income were partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $19.3 million.

The constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our consulting and education services revenues.

Excluding the impact of the surcharge revenue, our gross margin in fiscal year 2019 was 22.9 percent compared to 21.3 percent in fiscal year 2018. The results reflect the impact of improved product mix coupled with capacity gains and operating cost reductions compared to the same period a year ago. Fiscal year 2019 also reflects an $11.4 million benefit related to an insurance recovery in our third fiscal quarter."

While the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars, it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales. The following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharge on gross margin. We present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of surcharge provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. See the section “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion of these financial measures."

The EC concluded that this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules. However, whilst we are awaiting further detail from HMRC, the position has not changed from a tax accounting perspective. The risk is possible, but not probable. UK ministers have yet to decide on whether to pursue an appeal.

A total of $7.8 million of internally-developed software costs during 2018 and $6.3 million of internally-developed software costs during 2017 were capitalized, resulting in a decrease of the expense by $1.4 million compared to 2017."

The remaining $107.1 million (“post-Tax Act losses”) can be carried forward indefinitely but is subject to the 80% taxable income limitation. The pre-Tax Act U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts through 2037. The Company completed a Section 382 study for the period through March 31, 2019 and determined that a Section 382 ownership change occurred on December 31, 2017 subjecting all pre-Tax Act losses to a utilization limitation; however, such limitation is not expected to result in NOLs expiring unused. Any future annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOLs before utilization."

We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 2%.

The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms."

The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 27, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $218 million, of which approximately $77 million was recorded as deferred revenue."

In addition, demand for our NAND products was adversely affected by the transition from SATA SSDs to NVMe SSDs. The higher NAND sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of high-value mobile managed NAND products as well as discrete NAND products enabled by our execution in ramping 64- and 96-layer TLC 3D NAND."

We report total bookings without giving effect to refunds granted in the period because refunds often occur in periods different from the period of sale for reasons unrelated to the marketing efforts leading to the initial sale.

We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors."

We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. In addition, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the provisions of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective method. We recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to receivables of $7.6 million, an increase to inventories of $2.8 million, an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.9 million, an increase to other accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of $0.2 million. The adjustments primarily related to the timing of recognition of certain customer charges, trade promotional expenditures, and volume discounts."

The guidance allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impact.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers projected future taxable income, carryback opportunities, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company decreased its valuation allowance by $12.8 million which relates to a reduction in the valuation allowance on U.S. foreign tax credits offset by an increase in valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses."

The value of a wafer is determined principally by the complexity and performance of the processing technology used to produce the wafer, as well as by the yield and defect density. Production of devices with higher levels of functionality and performance, with better yields and lower defect density as well as with greater system-level integration requires better manufacturing expertise and generally commands higher wafer prices. The increase in price generally has more than offset associated increases in production cost once an appropriate economy of scale is reached."

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors."

Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 60 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our Customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, our Customer support renewal rate was approximately 91%, stable compared with the Customer support renewal rate during the quarter ended June 30, 2018."

Our growth rate can depend on a variety of factors, such as new customers, the size, volume, and complexity of our agreements with our customers, foreign currency movements, our ability to work with our customers to implement and deliver our products, our ability to upsell and renew our existing customers, the success of our alliance and partnership arrangements, and the expansion of our business through emerging markets. The decline in the growth rate of total revenue was driven by our strategic plan to transition away from one-time professional services and recommit our efforts to grow recurring revenue and free cash flows."

For contracts that include renewal provisions, revenue is recognized up-front upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligations, but payments are received upon renewal. Renewals occur in bi-annual and annual increments over the associated expected contract term, the majority of which range from two to five years. The Company’s contracts with customers under multi-year arrangements generally have three-year terms and are invoiced annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. The Company records a receivable related to revenue recognized under multi-year arrangements as the Company has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to these arrangements."

A substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer under the contracts that include renewal provisions is variable, and the amount and timing of that consideration varies based on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events that are not substantially within the Company’s control. With respect to multi-year year arrangements, there is minimal difference between the consideration received and the cash selling price, any offered discounts are driven by volume, and the contracts are of short duration resulting in insignificant interest. Thus, the primary purpose of the invoicing terms on the multi-year arrangements is to provide the customer with a simplified and predictable way of purchasing certain products, not to provide financing or to receive financing from the Company’s customer."

A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carry-forwards can be utilized. We assess all positive and negative evidence when determining the amount of the net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, prior earnings history, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable."

Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. As of April 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to reduce its existing valuation allowance resulting in less income tax expense. For the years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $1.3 million and $9.4 million, respectively."

These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions.

Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate.

For awards having both service and market conditions, the award fair value is calculated using Monte-Carlo simulations. Awards with service as well as market or performance conditions specify a target number of shares for the award, although each recipient ultimately has the opportunity to receive between 0% and 200% of the target number of shares. For awards with service and market conditions, the percentage received is based on our total shareholder return over the three-year service period versus that of selected peer companies. For awards with service and performance conditions, the percentage received depends upon the attainment of one or more financial performance targets during the two or three-year service period."

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of Golden Ridge’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 28, 2018.

In July 2019, we reached an agreement to settle the $0.6 million working capital adjustment receivable and other claims with the sellers of Golden Ridge. As a result, (i) 340,000 shares of common stock held in the escrow account ($1.0 million fair value as of both the settlement date and the November 28, 2018, acquisition date) were returned to us and retired, (ii) the remaining $0.4 million note payable we owed to a seller was cancelled and (iii) certain open grain purchase contracts with entities related to a seller were terminated. We recorded a gain on the noncash settlement of $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, which is included in other income. In connection with the foregoing, a settlement agreement was entered into among the parties. All shares of common stock were distributed and the escrow agreement was terminated."

Net sales for the segments are attributed to the region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed. The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments. A segment’s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income (loss). A segment’s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses  fiscal 2019 and the $13.5 million one-time employee bonus paid to full-time, non-executive employees during fiscal 2018 due to the Company's ability to access overseas cash as a result of Tax Reform (the \"one-time employee bonus\"). These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments.

Search advertising: Revenue is recognised at a point in time on a price-per-click basis, this is when a user engages with the search result on the website by clicking on it. 4. Services revenue: Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Services include training and implementation services. 5. Other revenue - Royalties: Royalties related to IP are recognised at a point in time when the subsequent sales occurs. 6. Interest income: Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the assets net carrying amount."
